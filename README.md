# Canary
An early warning of poison in the mines.

Canary is a mod that detects dangerous behavior of other mods.

Current features:
- Detecting registration of EntityDataSerializers
- Detecting unsafe registration of entity tracked data

### Fun Fact
This mod is named after the real life practice of using canaries in coal mines to detect
poisonous gasses. Like the real life counterpart, if the canary dies (the game crashes),
you've got a problem.
